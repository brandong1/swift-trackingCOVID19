# Purpose
This is a simple app developed in Swift that provides detailed statistics about Covid-19 (Coronavirus) across the globe.

# Functions
Within the app, you can view a list of all the countries, along with stats about: How many confirmed Covid-19 cases there are in each country, how many people have died and how many people have recovered.

There is also an interactive map that displays details about each country.

# Be advised
The API was too expensive, so this project is on hold until I identify a more economical way to obtain the data.
